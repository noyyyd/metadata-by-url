# url-metadata

url-metadata is a Go library for getting metadata from a link to a video file.

## Supported video formats:

1. mp4
2. m4p
3. mov
4. 3gp

All listed formats are supported only with MPEG-4 codec. If you found a video with MPEG-4 encoding and this package could not get the metadata of this video, please provide me this video and the problem will be fixed as soon as possible.

If you need to add support for any other format for your project, please contact me. I'll add it as soon as I have time.

## About

This project was implemented to solve a specific problem in the company where I work, but I will try to expand the functionality of this library.
